# To-do
**Gameplay Features**
- [ ]Fix potholes (Score penalty, temporary speed penalty, Game over?)
- [ ]Implement death/Game over
- [ ]Implement game-reset
- [ ]Implement dice as random powerup - Based on meyer scores? :O
- [ ]Add many different types of obstacles and platforms (Rare cars, Stairs or something)
- [ ]Add more gameplay relevant background items to street for flavor
- [ ]Add level speed up (Speed up shouldn't be too crazy-- Top speed must be playable, however difficult)
- [ ]Fix Road gap when gameSpeed exceeds 2-3 (No idea what causes this)
- [ ]Look into animations
- [ ]Add ice surface behavior
- [ ]Fix hit detection on pick-up-ables

**Polishing**
- [ ]Clean up parallax background function. Dictionaries/Hashmaps?
- [X]Rework item and object spawning/despawning. self.kill() on objects instead of changing location
- [ ]Rework jumping to allow jumps and double-jumps


**Ideas**
- Progessive obstacles... Different, stranger, more dangerous obstacles the further you get. Including environment changes
- Objective of the game is to avoid getting a concussion. Avoid tripping over a pothole, avoid getting run over by cars etc.
