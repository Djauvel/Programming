# To-do
**Gameplay Features**
- Fix potholes (Score penalty, temporary speed penalty, Game over?)
- Implement death/Game over
- Implement game-reset
- Implement collection of Dice as throwables?
- Add many different types of obstacles and platforms (Rare cars, Stairs or something)
- Add more gameplay relevant background items to street for flavor
- Add level speed up (Speed up shouldn't be too crazy-- Top speed must be playable, however difficult)
- Fix Road gap when gameSpeed exceeds 2-3 (No idea what causes this)
- Look into animations

**Polishing**
- Clean up parallax background function. Dictionaries/Hashmaps?
- Rework item and object spawning/despawning. self.kill() on objects instead of changing location
- Rework jumping to allow jumps and double-jumps


**Ideas**
- Progessive obstacles... Different, stranger, more dangerous obstacles the further you get. Including environment changes
- Objective of the game is to avoid getting a concussion. Avoid tripping over a pothole, avoid getting run over by cars etc.
